<p>Challenge looks the same as previous one, but it's says that there is no password in production, well we can see if there is any commits and if we are able to find any changes</p>

<p>The only change as we can see is only username, but that won't help us as there must be something else</p>

<p>As we can see that there is no password in production, we can possibly check if there is any other branch availabe to us</p>
