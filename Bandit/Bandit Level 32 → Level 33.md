## Solve ##
<p>Alright, we no have to escape to get the password for the next challenge, from the login we can see that this is some UPPERCASE SHELL</p>

<p>At first I was trying to look at the shell and see what commands are allowed to be run and it appeard that all of the commands were not found</p>

<p>Basically I was trying everything, and also went for re-search and to see how to escape restricted shells and the lucky finding for me was following characters</p>

<pre>
$0 returns the name of the running process. If used inside of a shell it will return the name of the shell.
</pre>

<p>This popped me a new shell and I was able to execute commands, so I went for vim to upgrade the shell</p>

<pre>
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell
</pre>

<p>Since we are able to execute commands now, I went to get the password for Bandit33</p>
