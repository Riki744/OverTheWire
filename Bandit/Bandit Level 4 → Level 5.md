# Bandit Level 4 → Level 5 #

## Level Goal ##
<p>The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.</p>

### Commands you may need to solve this level  ###
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

<li>We can use same command for find to find our directory , which I assume will probably on /home directory , but to be sure we can run it </li>

<li>From here we can go in this directory and try to cat the file out to get the password, but that did not worked, so I had to did some re-search</li>
<p>After playing around and looking for solution, I found out that with simple on liner bash we do get the password on the terminal</p>
