# Bandit Level 18 â†’ Level 19 #

## Level Goal ##
<p>The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.</p>

## Commands you may need to solve this level ##
<pre>
ssh, ls, cat
</pre>

## Solve ##
<p>As we know that from previous challenge when we try to login using SSH we got loged out instantly, from given commands we have only 3 options here, maybe it's possible to use SSH to login and at the same time execte another command</p>

<p>Simply by writing the cat for readme on homedirectory we are able to get the password for next challenge</p>
