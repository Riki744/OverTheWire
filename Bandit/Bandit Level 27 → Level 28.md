# Bandit Level 27 → Level 28 #

## Level Goal ##
<p>There is a git repository at ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.</p>
Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

## Commands you may need to solve this level ##
<pre>
git
</pre>

## Solve ##
<p>If this is first time using git, I recommend looking into the manpages as it will help to get better understanding of what git command can do,
  but to solve this we simply execute following command and as we don't have write access to home we should create new folder</p>
